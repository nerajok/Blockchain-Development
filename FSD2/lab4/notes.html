		<p id="rectify"> A classification problem is a supervised learning problem that asks for a choice between two or more classes, usually providing probabilities for each class. Leaving out neural networks and deep learning, which require a much higher level of computing resources, the most common algorithms are Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). You can also use ensemble methods (combinations of models), such as Random Forest, other Bagging methods, and boosting methods such as AdaBoost and XGBoost. <p>

		<p> A regression problem is a supervised learning problem that asks the model to predict a number. The simplest and fastest algorithm is linear (least squares) regression, but you shouldn’t stop there, because it often gives you a mediocre result. Other common machine learning regression algorithms (short of neural networks) include Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization), LARS Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. You’ll notice that there is some overlap between machine learning algorithms for regression and classification.</p>

		<p> A clustering problem is an unsupervised learning problem that asks the model to find groups of similar data points. The most popular algorithm is K-Means Clustering; others include Mean-Shift Clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models), and HAC (Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering). </p>

		<p> Absolute positioning: The position of an image or content doesnt change even when window is resized, it just gets cut-out or hidden. </p>
		
		<p> Relative positioning: The content gets positioned in terms of "em" units and changes acording to the display sizes more like dynamic positioning.</p>
		
		<p> Fixed positioning: The content gets fixed in one position and doesn't move even when scrolled. Its just fixed in that particular pixel positions.</p>

        <h3>HTML tags are keywords that help the web browser render the properties of the elements. Example: &ltBR&gt.</h3>
          <p> Using border model we can calculate the height and width by highlighting the element and adding the area of content along with borders. </p>
          <p>####The height of the element is 250px and width of the content is 400px.</p>
          <p>####The height of the content is 242px and width of the content is 392px.</p>

        <h2> Lab 2: 2 HTML Knowledge </h2>

        <p>HTML tag: HTML tags are keywords that help the web browser or HTML reader application render the properties of the elements. Example: &ltBR&gt </p>

        <p>Empty Tag:  Tags without any contents are called as empty tags. The difference between a regular and empty tag is that the empty tag does not needs to be closed. </p>

        <p>Attribute: Attributes are used to mention a specific property of the HTML tag. Examples being width, height, etc</p>

        <p>Nesting a tag: Proper way to nest a tag is to close the tag that was last opened.</p>


        <p id="sample01"> ID of HTML tag: An ID can be added at the opening of an tag. </p>

        <p id="sample02" class="proto01"> Class of HTML tag: A class can be used to group the elements that may be sharing similar properties </p>

        <p> ID vs Class: ID is used to identify an element while using CSS. Class is used to give a similar property to a group of elements.</p>

        <p> Type Selector: It is used to match the elements with the element node names</p>

        <p>Head tag: Head tag is used to mention the information about the webpage. Some tags within head are title, meta </p>

        <p>Body Tag: Body tag is used to mention the main contents of the webpage. Some tags within body tags are h1,p,etc</p>

        <h4>CSS Reset USAGE: A css reset is used to reset all the styling to the default styles of the web browser.</h4>
        <h4>CSS Reset IMPACT: Adding a css reset changed all my coloring and font styles to default browser style!</h4>
