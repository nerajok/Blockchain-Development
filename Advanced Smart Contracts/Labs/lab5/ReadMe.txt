Notes:

1. Worked on Windows environment with ganache-cli.
2. Web3.Js works fine. Contract interaction successful. Able to increase and decrease amount.
3. I couldn't get the event listener up for ganache-cli websocket URI port. The designated port is 8545 according to community.
4. EventListener never threw any errors but didn't respond either.
